#AotearoaDirections 

As with AotearoaAccommodations, I was extremely excited to go to New Zealand on a self-organized school trip. I had the program for Accommodation, so it would take care of where we were staying for the night, and created this prorgram to go alongside it to make sure we knew exactly how to get from one place to another (just in case we were stranded somewhere else). 

##Things I learned 
 + This was my first time using Java GUIs (ie: learning how to make JTextFields, and JButtons) and making the buttons functional. 
 
##Things I would change 
 + The variables in Directions should be private, so that I can apply getters and setters to them to hide it from client code 
 + I feel as if another data structure (ie: ArrayList) would be better used in this scenario,
